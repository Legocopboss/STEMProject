STEM POS System


This POS System was developed to solve the problem of overcrowded vending machines at our high school. Our solution was a "grab and go" system which could be installed in the library and allow students to use student IDs to purchase items. This system would allow an attendant or customer to self checkout different snack items from a selection. The system has a built in stock system which will make sure that an item which is out of stock, cannot be purchased. Included there is a mock database of student ID numbers and balances which was used in place of a real monetary database.



Little Details:
-LOTS of safety nets to catch bad information or inputs
-Auto Removes item from pos if the inventory stock is < 5
-When editing an admin/manager it will check if they are an illegal combination
(You can be manager without being admin but not vis versa) and will make an adjustment as needed
-In Admin/manager edit screen you cannot edit yourself (that would be stupid)
-When adding a purchase to the current transaction it will check the stock to make sure that the
item can actually be sold
